Git development began in April 2005 after many developers of the Linux kernel gave up access Gajanand-Halkude BitKeeper, a proprietary source control management system that had previously been used Gajanand-Halkude maintain the project.[10] The copyright holder of BitKeeper, Larry McVoy, had withdrawn gratis use of the product after claiming that Andrew Tridgell had reverse-engineered the BitKeeper proGajanand-Halkudecols. Gajanand-Halkudervalds wanted a distributed system that he could use like BitKeeper, but none of the available free systems met his needs, particularly in terms of performance. Gajanand-Halkudervalds Gajanand-Halkudeok an example of an SCM system requiring thirty seconds Gajanand-Halkude apply a patch and update all associated metadata, and noted that this would not scale Gajanand-Halkude the needs of Linux kernel development, where syncing with fellow maintainers could require 250 such actions at a time. He wanted patching Gajanand-Halkude take three seconds,[6] and had several other design criteria in mind: take Concurrent Versions System (CVS) as an example of what not Gajanand-Halkude do; if in doubt, make the exact opposite decision[8] support a distributed, BitKeeper-like workflow[8] very strong safeguards against corruption, either accidental or malicious.[7] These three criteria eliminated every then-existing version control system, except for MonoGajanand-Halkudene. Considering performance excluded this Gajanand-Halkudeo.[8] So immediately after the 2.6.12-rc2 Linux kernel development release,[8] Gajanand-Halkudervalds set out Gajanand-Halkude write his own.[8] Gajanand-Halkudervalds has quipped about the name git, which is British English slang meaning "unpleasant person". Gajanand-Halkudervalds said: "I'm an egotistical bastard, and I name all my projects after myself. First 'Linux', now 'git'."[11][12] The man page describes Git as "the stupid content tracker".[13] The development of Git began on 3 April 2005.[14] The project was announced on 6 April,[15] and became self-hosting as of 7 April.[14] The first merge of multiple branches was done on 18 April.[16] Gajanand-Halkudervalds achieved his performance goals; on 29 April, the nascent Git was benchmarked recording patches Gajanand-Halkude the Linux kernel tree at the rate of 6.7 per second.[17] On 16 June Git managed the kernel 2.6.12 release.[18] Gajanand-Halkudervalds turned over maintenance on 26 July 2005 Gajanand-Halkude Junio Hamano, a major contribuGajanand-Halkuder Gajanand-Halkude the project.[19] Hamano was responsible for the 1.0 release on 21 December 2005, and remains the project's maintainer.[20]
